## packages

when it comes to dependancies, i havent tested if this is everything needed, there could be a few missing, but heres everything i can think of. also please dont just copy paste these, if you dont want something, dont install it! this is just what i use. <br />

pacman:
```
hyprland waybar hyprlock foot btop swww rofi imagemagick power-profiles-daemon wl-clipboard grim slurp networkmanager pulseaudio
```
and aur:
```
rofi-bluetooth-git light ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd ttf-cascadia-mono-nerd
```
note if your brightness keys dont work, you need to allow "light" to run without sudo:
```
sudo chmod +s /usr/bin/light
```
programs i recommend (not needed, install whatever alternatives you want)
```
kitty
dolphin
firefox
code (pacman) or visual-studio-code (aur)
spotify (i recommend spicetify to make pretty)
discord / vesktop (what i use)
steam
fish shell
```
